# Enhanced PRD System

## Overview

The END_CAP Agent Factory includes a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) system that follows industry best practices and ensures complete, professional documentation for every AI agent project.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Voice-First Design**
- **Unified Input**: Whether you speak or type, you get the same professional PRD format
- **Natural Language Processing**: Voice input is preserved and integrated into the final document
- **Devin-Ready Output**: Standardized markdown files optimized for Devin AI implementation

### ðŸ“Š **Smart Completion Tracking**
- **Automatic Calculation**: System calculates completion percentage based on filled sections
- **Weighted Scoring**: Important sections (like Problem Statement) have higher weights
- **Status Management**: PRDs are marked as "draft" until 100% complete, then "submitted"
- **Missing Section Detection**: Identifies exactly which sections need attention

### ðŸ¤– **Guided Questions System**
For each missing section, the system provides:
- **Main Question**: Direct, focused question about the section
- **Sub-Questions**: 3-4 clarifying questions to help think through the topic
- **Real Examples**: Concrete examples to guide thinking
- **Context**: Why this section matters for the project

## Interactive Completion

- Start a draft: `POST /api/v1/prds/interactive`
- Get next question: `GET /api/v1/prds/{id}/next-question`
- Submit answer: `POST /api/v1/prds/{id}/answer`
- JSON Schema: `GET /api/v1/prds/schema`

The flow asks required sections in a fixed sequence, then optional sections. When completion reaches 100%, status auto-transitions to `submitted`.

## PRD Structure

```

## Best Practices

### **Start Simple, Complete Systematically**
1. Begin with basic title, description, and requirements
2. Use guided questions to complete missing sections
3. Work through sections in order of importance
4. Aim for 100% completion before submitting to Devin AI

### **Voice Input Best Practices**
- Speak naturally about the problem you're trying to solve
- Include context about users and use cases
- Mention any technical constraints or requirements
- The system will extract and structure your input

### **Text Input Best Practices**
- Be specific about the problem and solution
- Include user personas and workflows
- Mention success criteria and metrics
- Consider technical and business constraints

### **Quality Checklist**
- [ ] Problem statement clearly defines the pain point
- [ ] Target users are specific and well-defined
- [ ] User stories follow "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
- [ ] Requirements are actionable and testable
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success metrics are quantifiable
- [ ] Timeline is realistic and includes milestones

## Integration with Devin AI

The PRD system is specifically designed to work seamlessly with Devin AI:

### **Optimized Markdown Output**
- Professional formatting with clear sections
- Technical specifications for implementation
- Repository structure and deployment instructions
- Success criteria and testing requirements

### **Complete Context**
- All necessary information for agent development
- Integration requirements and dependencies
- Performance and security considerations
- Monitoring and maintenance requirements

### **Ready for Implementation**
- No additional preparation needed
- Direct copy-paste to Devin AI
- Comprehensive implementation guidance
- Clear success metrics for validation

## Examples

### **Voice Input Example**
```
"I need a customer support bot that can handle common questions, 
escalate complex issues to human agents, and learn from interactions. 
It should integrate with our existing ticketing system and provide 
24/7 support for our customers."
```

**Result**: System extracts requirements, identifies missing sections, and provides guided questions to complete the PRD.

### **Text Input Example**
```
"Create an email automation agent that can:
- Parse incoming emails and extract key information
- Categorize emails by type and priority
- Generate appropriate responses based on templates
- Integrate with our CRM system
- Handle 1000+ emails per day with 99% accuracy"
```

**Result**: System structures the input and guides completion of all required sections.
