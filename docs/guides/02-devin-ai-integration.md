```

### **Required API Endpoints**
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint (required for platform integration)
- `POST /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/execute` - Execute agent
- `GET /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/status` - Get agent status
- `GET /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/metrics` - Get agent metrics

### **Database Schema**
- `agents` - Agent metadata and configuration
- `agent_executions` - Execution logs and results
- `agent_metrics` - Performance and usage metrics
