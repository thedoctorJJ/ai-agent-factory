**Example Analysis Response:**
```
## Your PRD Analysis:

‚úÖ Strong Sections:
- Problem Statement - Clear and specific
- Success Metrics - Measurable and actionable
- User Stories - Well-defined personas and use cases

üîç Areas We Could Enhance:
- Target Users - Could be more explicit about primary users

- Set Timeline: Add specific milestones, deadlines, and delivery dates

What would you like to focus on first?
```

| user, customer, audience, who | target_users | "Great! I've noted your target users..." |
| requirement, need, must, feature | requirements | "Excellent! I've added that requirement..." |
| success, metric, measure, kpi | success_metrics | "Perfect! I've captured your success metric..." |
| timeline, schedule, deadline | timeline | "Great! I've noted your timeline..." |
