# Devin AI Integration Framework

## Overview
Devin AI acts as the autonomous engineering layer, connecting PRDs, agent libraries, and orchestration workflows to automatically create, update, and execute agents.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Agent Review**: Scans Agent Library and Tool Library.
2. **Orchestration Plan Generation**: Reads PRD JSON or GitHub repo and generates `manifest.json`.
3. **Agent Creation**: Builds agent files, adds prompts, tools, and metadata.
4. **Execution**: Deploys agents through FastAPI endpoints and connects to Supabase vector DB.
5. **Versioning & Governance**: Maintains agent versions and audit logs.

## Interaction Flow
```
[PRD / GitHub Repo] --> Devin AI
↓
[Agent Library + Tool Library] --> Analysis
↓
[Orchestration Plan Generated]
↓
[New Agent Scaffolds + Metadata Updated in Supabase]
↓
[Execution via FastAPI / Cloud Run]
```

## Key Principles
- Fully autonomous but auditable
- Reusable components
- Modular orchestration
- Integration-ready with voice, GitHub MCP, and frontend dashboard
