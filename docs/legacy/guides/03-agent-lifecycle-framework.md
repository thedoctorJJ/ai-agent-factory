# Agent Lifecycle Framework

## Overview
Defines the lifecycle of an agent from creation to retirement.

## Stages
1. **Ideation**: Define the purpose, scope, and PRD.
2. **Creation**: Generate agent scaffold and code.
3. **Registration**: Store metadata, version, and tool attachments.
4. **Orchestration**: Connect with other agents or modules as needed.
5. **Monitoring**: Track usage, logs, and performance.
6. **Retirement**: Decommission or archive agents safely.

## Governance
- Versioning of agents
- Audit logs in Supabase
- Reuse of prompts and tools from libraries
