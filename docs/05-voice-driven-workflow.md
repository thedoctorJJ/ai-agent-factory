# Voice-Driven Workflow Design

## Overview
Enables agent creation through voice conversations in ChatGPT, with completed PRDs uploaded to the END_CAP Agent Factory for automated agent generation.

## Workflow Stages
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Voice Conversation | User speaks with ChatGPT about their agent idea |
| Creative Draft | ChatGPT helps create initial PRD based on conversation |
| Template Application | ChatGPT applies structured template to the draft |
| PRD Export | ChatGPT exports completed PRD as markdown |
| PRD Upload | User uploads completed PRD to END_CAP Agent Factory |
| Agent Generation | END_CAP creates AI agent from PRD specifications |
| Repository Creation | GitHub repository automatically created |
| Deployment | Agent deployed and ready for use |

## Data Flow
```
[User Voice in ChatGPT] --> Creative Conversation
↓
[ChatGPT] --> Structured PRD (Markdown)
↓
[User Upload] --> END_CAP Agent Factory
↓
[AI Factory] --> Agent Generation
↓
[GitHub] --> Repository Creation
↓
[Deployment] --> Live Agent
```

## Principles
- Voice conversations happen in ChatGPT, not in END_CAP
- END_CAP focuses on agent creation from completed PRDs
- End-to-end automation with real-time feedback
- Modular and repeatable
