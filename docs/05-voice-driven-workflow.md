# Voice-Driven Workflow Design

## Overview
**Note**: This document describes the external workflow where voice conversations in ChatGPT create PRDs that are then uploaded to the AI Agent Factory. The AI Agent Factory itself does not handle voice input - it receives completed PRDs for agent generation.

## Workflow Stages
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Voice Conversation | User speaks with ChatGPT about their agent idea |
| Creative Draft | ChatGPT helps create initial PRD based on conversation |
| Template Application | ChatGPT applies structured template to the draft |
| PRD Export | ChatGPT exports completed PRD as markdown |
| PRD Upload | User uploads completed PRD to AI Agent Factory |
| Agent Generation | AI Agent Factory creates AI agent from PRD specifications |
| Repository Creation | GitHub repository automatically created |
| Deployment | Agent deployed and ready for use |

## Data Flow
```
[User Voice in ChatGPT] --> Creative Conversation
↓
[ChatGPT] --> Structured PRD (Markdown)
↓
[User Upload] --> AI Agent Factory
↓
[AI Factory] --> Agent Generation
↓
[GitHub] --> Repository Creation
↓
[Deployment] --> Live Agent
```

## Principles
- **Voice conversations happen in ChatGPT, not in AI Agent Factory**
- **AI Agent Factory receives completed PRDs and focuses on agent creation**
- **No voice input or PRD creation within the AI Agent Factory application**
- End-to-end automation with real-time feedback
- Modular and repeatable
