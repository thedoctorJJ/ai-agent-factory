# Standardizing PRDs

This folder contains PRDs that are currently being converted to match AI Agent Factory standards.

## Purpose

PRDs in this folder are being standardized using our templates to ensure they:
- Follow the correct structure
- Include all required technical infrastructure details
- Are compatible with our AI Agent Factory platform
- Can be processed effectively by Devin AI

## What Happens Here

1. **Template Selection**: System chooses appropriate template (agent or platform)
2. **Content Mapping**: User content is mapped to template structure
3. **Infrastructure Addition**: Technical requirements are added from templates
4. **Validation**: Standardized PRD is validated for completeness
5. **Move**: Standardized PRD moves to `review/` folder for user approval

## Status

- **Status**: `standardizing`
- **Action**: Being converted to AI Agent Factory format
- **Next Step**: Will move to `review/` when standardization is complete
