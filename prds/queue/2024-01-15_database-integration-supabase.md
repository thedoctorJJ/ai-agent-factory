## **Title**

**Database Integration with Supabase**

---

## **Description**

This agent integrates the **AI Agent Factory** with a persistent **Supabase PostgreSQL backend**, replacing volatile in-memory storage. The integration ensures reliable and scalable data persistence for agents, PRDs, and configurations, supporting collaboration, version control, and long-term system resilience.

---

## **Problem Statement**

The **AI Agent Factory** currently uses in-memory storage, causing all data to be lost after system restarts and limiting scalability. This lack of persistence hinders multi-user collaboration, auditability, and system reliability. Integrating **Supabase** provides a durable, scalable database layer that resolves these issues and supports long-term data integrity.

---

## **Target Users**

* **AI Agents** that require persistent data storage to maintain state, configuration, and performance history across sessions.
* **AI Agent Developers** who build, test, and deploy agents within the AI Agent Factory and need reliable backend infrastructure for data management.
* **Product Managers** who oversee agent performance, lifecycle management, and data consistency across production environments.

---

## **User Stories**

* As an **AI Agent**, I need to persist my configuration, learning history, and state across sessions so that I can continue functioning seamlessly after restarts.
* As an **AI Agent Developer**, I want to create, update, and manage agent and PRD data in a reliable Supabase backend to ensure stability and reproducibility.
* As a **Product Manager**, I need access to consistent and historical agent data to monitor performance, manage releases, and make informed decisions on optimization.

## **Requirements**

1. Establish a secure and authenticated connection with Supabase PostgreSQL using API keys or service roles.
2. Design and implement normalized data models for **AI Agents** and **PRDs**, supporting relationships, versioning, and metadata tracking.
3. Implement **CRUD operations** through a well-defined data access layer or ORM.
4. Add **database migration**, **schema validation**, and **rollback** capabilities for safe deployment.
5. Configure **connection pooling**, **retry logic**, and **transaction management** to ensure stability.
6. Implement **data backup**, **restore**, and **disaster recovery** workflows.
7. Maintain backward compatibility with existing in-memory structures during transition.
8. Add **audit logging** and **metrics instrumentation** for performance and usage monitoring.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**

* All **AI Agent** and **PRD** entities are stored and retrieved persistently through Supabase.
* System restarts or crashes do **not** result in any data loss.
* All CRUD operations pass **integration and end-to-end (E2E)** tests with 100% reliability.
* **Database migrations** execute successfully in both development and production environments.
* **Backup and restore** procedures are validated under simulated failure conditions.
* The system maintains **<200ms average query latency** under normal load.
* The data access layer returns **consistent and versioned** records for agents and PRDs.

## **Technical Requirements (Aligned with AI Agent Factory Infrastructure)**

* **Backend:** Python 3.11 using **FastAPI**, deployed as a containerized microservice on **Google Cloud Run**.
* **Frontend:** **Next.js 14** dashboard built with **TypeScript** and **shadcn/ui**, integrated with the backend API.
* **Database:** **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** serves as the persistent data layer for agents, PRDs, and related metadata.
* **Local Development:** PostgreSQL 15 and Redis 7, managed via **Docker Compose** with persistent volumes for data retention.
* **ORM / Schema Management:** Alembic for database migrations and Supabase CLI for schema synchronization and rollback automation.
* **Authentication & Security:**

  * **JWT-based authentication** for user sessions and API endpoints.
  * **Supabase service role keys** and credentials securely managed in **Google Cloud Secret Manager**.
  * **CORS** configured for controlled access from production and staging environments.
* **CI/CD & Deployment:**

  * Continuous integration and deployment through **Google Cloud Build** pipelines to **Cloud Run**.
  * **Docker multi-stage builds** for optimized image sizes and reproducible builds.
  * Environment configuration and version control managed under `config/env/`.
* **Monitoring & Logging:**

  * **Structured JSON logging** across all services for unified observability.
  * **Google Cloud Logging** used for centralized log aggregation and analysis.
  * **Health check endpoints** (`/api/v1/health`) actively monitored for uptime and service readiness.
* **Backup & Recovery:**

  * **Automated daily backups** configured within Supabase.
  * **Regular recovery validation** in staging to ensure restore reliability.
* **Performance Optimization:**

  * **Connection pooling** via Supabase edge functions for scalability.
  * **Redis caching** to accelerate frequent queries and session management.
  * **Database indexing** and query optimization for PostgreSQL tables.
* **Testing:**

  * **Integration and unit tests** implemented using `pytest` (backend) and `Jest` (frontend).
  * **Infrastructure validation scripts** ensure deployment health post-release.
