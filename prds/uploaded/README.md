# Uploaded PRDs

This folder contains PRDs that have been uploaded by users but need to be standardized to match AI Agent Factory requirements.

## Purpose

Users can upload PRDs in any format (from ChatGPT, manual creation, or other sources), but they need to be converted to our standardized format before processing.

## What Happens Here

1. **Upload**: Users upload PRDs to this folder
2. **Classification**: System determines if it's an agent or platform PRD
3. **Standardization**: PRD is converted using appropriate template
4. **Move**: Standardized PRD moves to `queue/` folder

## File Naming

Use descriptive filenames:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_prd-title-description.md
```

## Status

- **Action**: Awaiting standardization
- **Next Step**: Will be converted to AI Agent Factory format
